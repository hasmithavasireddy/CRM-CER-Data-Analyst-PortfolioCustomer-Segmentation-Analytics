# CRM / CER Data Analyst Portfolio

## Project Overview

This repository showcases my capabilities as a CRM / Customer Engagement and Retention (CER) Data Analyst, aligning closely with the job requirements for a role focused on supporting CER teams through data-driven decision-making. It includes two comprehensive Python notebooks that demonstrate critical analysis, data integration, and actionable insights generation within the context of CRM and Loyalty campaigns.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:** To conduct a thorough exploration of customer data, focusing on identifying key characteristics, behaviors, and patterns that can inform strategic marketing decisions.
**Dataset:** Utilizes a rich dataset featuring customer transactions, demographic information, and marketing campaign responses.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
* Data Cleaning and Preparation: Addressing missing values, standardizing categories, and creating meaningful features.
* Descriptive Analysis: Profiling average customer attributes, product preferences, and sales channel effectiveness.
* Visualization: Employing seaborn and matplotlib to visualize customer behaviors and campaign performance.

### 2. Customer Segmentation and Analytics

**Objective:** To segment the customer base and analyze CRM & Loyalty campaign performance, providing actionable insights for optimizing marketing strategies.

**Dataset:** Incorporates transactional data, including purchase quantities, unit prices, and customer demographics.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
* Revenue Calculation: Deriving total revenue from transactional data to understand customer value.
* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction: Utilizing machine learning models to predict future customer value.
* Segmentation Analysis: Employing clustering techniques (e.g., KMeans) for demographic and behavioral segmentation.
* Campaign Analysis: Analyzing campaign data to assess effectiveness and identify optimization opportunities.

### Skills Demonstrated:

* Data Analysis and Integration: Expertise in synthesizing data from multiple sources to provide comprehensive insights.
* Data Modeling: Although not explicitly shown in the notebooks, the methodologies applied suggest a strong foundation in data manipulation and querying, essential for constructing complex data models.
* Statistical and Machine Learning Analysis: Application of statistical tests and machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling and segmentation.
* Tools and Technologies: Proficient use of Python, pandas for data manipulation, sklearn for machine learning, and Plotly for interactive visualizations. Demonstrates a keen ability to leverage technology for advanced analytics.
* Communication: Each notebook is structured to not only perform analyses but also to articulate findings clearly, underscoring the importance of communicating insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Conclusion**
The analyses conducted across these notebooks underscore my capability to drive CRM and loyalty marketing initiatives forward through data-driven insights. By integrating customer transaction data, demographic information, and campaign responses, I have demonstrated a comprehensive approach to understanding and enhancing customer engagement and retention strategies.
